Hi! I am Emily, a Year 3 Information Systems student majoring in Business Analytics with second major Data Science and Analytics.

This website is part of my current course, IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Application, where I will be exploring geospatial analytics with R.

Hope that this website will show all my works and beneficial for me to showcase the works I have done in terms of Geospatial analytics.

Thank you! :)
